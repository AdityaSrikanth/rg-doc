SAML 2.0
^^^^^^^^

SAML is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. SAML is an XML-based markup language for security assertions

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard for logging users into applications based on their sessions in another context. This single sign-on (SSO) login standard has significant advantages over logging in using a username/password

RLCatalyst Research Gateway supports integration with Identity Providers that support SAML 2.0. If you need your instance of the gateway integrated with your IdP please contact us.

Publishing Research Gateway as SaaS solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The goal of this exercise is to publish Research Gateway as a software as a service (SaaS) solution on AWS Marketplace and how to integrate it with the appropriate AWS Marketplace APIs. With software as a service (SaaS) products, you deploy software hosted on AWS infrastructure and grant buyers access to the software in your AWS environment. This section explains the basic concepts involved in deploying a product as SaaS.

Pricing model
-------------
AWS Marketplace oﬀers two pricing models for SaaS listings

1. **SaaS subscriptions**: We track the usage of the customer and the customer pays only for what they use. This pay-as-you-go pricing model is similar to that of many Amazon Web Services (AWS) services. Billing for the usage of a SaaS product is managed through AWS bill
2. **SaaS contracts** : Saas contracts allow the customer to purchase discrete quantities of licenses for the product and have them billed, in advance, through their AWS account. For example, they might purchase 10 user access licenses for a year.

**For our product, we will be using the SaaS contracts model**.

Entitlements
-------------
If your product is a SaaS contracts product, your product calls the AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service to retrieve the customer’s entitlement using the GetEntitlements. Your product should verify subsequent usage on that account against the AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service. For example, if the customer provisions 10 users on the account, your product should check the AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service for entitlement to that capacity.

SaaS Subscription Steps
-----------------------
The below steps that will be done for publishing our product as Saas in the AWS marketplace.

**a. User Subscription**

When our product has been listed for consumption in the AWS marketplace, customers can subscribe to our product.

1. Log in to AWS account with valid credentials. Navigate to AWS Marketplace.
2. Type “RLCatalyst” in the search bar. We can see the result as **RLCatalyst Research Gateway(Saas)** 
    a. Show the pricing information(Small/Medium/Large). 
	b. Show option of Monthly or Annual. 
	c. Show option of Auto-renewal (Yes/No).
	
 Click on the “Continue on Subscribe” button which is available at the top right side of the page. Fill the required parameters like contract options and renewal settings. Now click on the “Create contract” button. Click on “Pay Now” button. After completion of payment options, the user will be redirected to the RG registration website.
 
**b. Registration page**

After subscribing to the product, the customer is directed to a website we create and manage as a part of our SaaS product to register their account and conﬁgure the product. When creating our product, we provide a URL to our registration landing page. AWS Marketplace 
uses that URL to redirect customers to our registration landing page after they subscribe. On our software's registration URL, we collect whatever information is required to create an account for the customer. After successful registration, we will be notifying the customer 
when the product is available for them to consume with a login URL and admin credentials.

**c. Create a new instance of the portal**

When a new customer signs up for our product, we will be creating a new instance of our product and host it in a different environment for 
the customer. An URL will be created for the new environment which they will be shared with the customer. Once a new environment 
is created, we will seed admin credentials to the database and the same will be shared with the customer along with the URL created in the previous step.

1. Login to the Research Gateway  with the new password. Navigate to the Provider settings and click on the “+Add New” button ---Fill the required parameters and click on the “Add” button.
2. Navigate to the “Users” through the left navigation menu.

   **Note**: Assign the researcher to the organization while .
5. Navigate to “My Organization” through the left navigation menu . Users can create a new organization with the “+Add New” button on the landing page.
6. Navigate to catalog through the left navigation menu . In the filter select the “View -Standard catalog “  option and enable the checkboxes which are available at the right side of the products and click on the “Assign to selected O.U” button. Select the organization in the list box and click on the “Assign” button.

   Choose the product and click on the “Launch Now” button. Fill the required parameters in the form and launch it. 
   **Note**: While creating the EC2 we need to enter the key pair name.  Navigate to the keypairs through the left navigation menu. Click on the “+Create New” button. Fill the required parameters and click on the “Create key pair” button. New key pair was created. Now navigate to the available products panel. Choose EC2 product and fill the params and click on the “Launch Now” button. The product was launched successfully.

**d. Tracking usage**

When the product is live for the customer to use, we have to track the usage of the customer based on the pricing model they chose while subscribing to our product and the dimension they are consuming. For software as a service (SaaS) subscriptions, we meter for all usage, and then customers are billed by AWS based on the metering records that we provide. For SaaS contracts, we only make sure that the customer is not using the product beyond the contract’s entitlements.
